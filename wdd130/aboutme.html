    <p>Hello everyone, I live in Tennessee, but was born and raised a couple of years in Mexico.
       I am currently working towards getting my programming degree, this being my second year. 
       I like spending my free time reading, playing sports (especially soccer and basketball), and
       watching movies and of course sports. Not to be bias or anything, but I really enjoy Mexican food,
       especially tacos. If I could I would eat it everyday, but I also enjoy discovering different foods and tastes.
       Excited to be in this class and hope to have a great semester will you all.</p>
